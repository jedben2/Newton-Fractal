# Newton-Fractal
Program to iterate over the newton-raphson method for finding roots in order to get a map of convergence for an area of points over the complex plane

For deeper iterations / higher density of pixels the program slows down. I tend to keep it on 1000 spacing for a clean image

To use: Go into the program and adjust the spacing, width and iterations parameters to your desire
